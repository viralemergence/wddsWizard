Group,Variable,Descriptor
Data,Sample ID,"A researcher-generated unique ID for the sample: usually a unique string of both characters and integers (e.g., “OS BZ19-114” to indicate an oral swab taken from animal BZ19-114; see worked example below), to avoid conflicts that can arise when datasets are merged with number-only notation for samples. Ideally, sample names should be kept consistent across all online databases and physical resources (e.g., museum collections or project-specific sample archives)."
,Animal ID,"A researcher-generated unique ID for the individual animal from which the sample was collected: usually a unique string of both characters and integers (e.g., “BZ19-114” to indicate animal 114 sampled in 2019 in Belize). Ideally, animal names should again be kept consistent across online databases and physical resources."
,Latitude,Latitude of the collection site in decimal format.
,Longitude,Longitude of the collection site in decimal format.
,"Spatial uncertainty
(optional)","Coordinate uncertainty from GPS recordings, post-hoc digitization, or systematic alterations (e.g., jittering or rounding) expressed in meters."
,Collection day,The day of the month on which the specimen was collected.
,Collection month,The numeric month in which the specimen was collected.
,Collection year,The year in which the specimen was collected.
,Collection method and/or tissue,"The technique used to acquire the sample and/or the tissue from which the sample was extracted (e.g., “oropharyngeal swab”)"
,Host identification,"The Linnaean classification of the animal from which the sample was collected, reported at the lowest possible level (ideally, species binomial name: e.g., “Odocoileus virginianus” or “Ixodes scapularis”). As necessary, researchers may also include an additional field indicating when uncertainty exists in the identification of the host organism (see “Adding new fields”)."
,"Organism sex
(optional)",The sex of the individual animal from which the sample was collected.
,"Dead or alive
(optional)
dwc:vitality","The state of the individual animal from which the sample was collected, at the time of sample collection."
,"Health notes
(optional)","Any additional (unstructured) notes about the state of the animal, such as disease presentation."
,"Host life stage
(optional)
dwc:lifeStage","The life stage of the animal from which the sample was collected (as appropriate for the organism) (e.g., “juvenile”, “adult”)."
,"Age
(optional)","The numeric age of the animal from which the sample was collected, at the time of sample collection, if known (e.g., in monitored populations)."
,"Age units
(optional)",The units in which age is measured (usually years).
,"Mass
(optional)","The mass of the animal from which the sample was collected, at the time of sample collection."
,"Mass units
(optional)","The units that mass is recorded in (e.g., “kg”)."
,"Length
(optional)","The numeric length of the animal from which the sample was collected, at the time of sample collection."
,"Length measurement
(optional)","The axis of measurement for the organism being measured (e.g., “snout-vent length” or just “SVL”; “wing length”; “primary feather”)."
,"Length units
(optional)","The units that length is recorded in (e.g., “meters”)."
,"Organism quantity
(optional)",A number or enumeration value for the quantity of organisms.
,"Organism quantity type
(optional)",The units that organism quantity is recorded in (e.g. “individuals”).
,Detection target,"The taxonomic identity of the parasite being screened for in the sample. This will often be coarser than the identity of a specific parasite identified in the sample: for example, in a study screening for novel bat coronaviruses, the entire family Coronaviridae might be the target; in a parasite dissection, the targets might be Acanthocephala, Cestoda, Nematoda, and Trematoda. For deep sequencing approaches (e.g., metagenomic and metatranscriptomic viral discovery), researchers should report each alignment target used as a new “test” to maximize reporting of negative data, or alternatively, select a subset that reflect specific study objectives and the focus of analysis (e.g., specific viral families)."
,Detection method,"The type of test performed to detect the parasite or parasite-specific antibody (e.g., 'qPCR', ‘ELISA’)."
,"Primer sequence
(optional)","The sequence of both forward and reverse primers used to identify the sample (e.g., “forward 5’ CDCAYGARTTYTGYTCNCARC 3' ; reverse 5’ RHGGRTANGCRTCWATDGC 3'”) or just the name of a commonly used gene target (particularly if citation information is given)."
,"Primer citation
(optional)","Citation for the primer being used. (e.g. title, doi, or other permanent identifier for a work)."
,Detection outcome,"The test result (i.e., “positive”, “negative”, or “inconclusive”). To avoid ambiguity, these specific values are suggested over numeric values (“0” or “1”)."
,"Detection measurement
(optional)","Any numeric measurement of parasite detection that is more detailed than simple positive or negative results (e.g., viral titer, parasite counts, sequence reads)."
,"Detection measurement units
(optional)","Units for quantitative measurements of parasite intensity or test results (e.g., “Ct”, “TCID50/mL”, or “parasite count”)."
,Parasite identification,"The identity of a parasite detected by the test, if any, reported to the lowest possible taxonomic level, either as a Linnaean binomial classification or within the convention of a relevant taxonomic authority (e.g., “Borrelia burgdorferi” or “Zika virus”). Parasite identification may be more specific than detection target."
,"Parasite life stage
(optional)","The life stage of the parasite from which the sample was collected (as appropriate for the organism) (e.g., “juvenile”, “adult”)."
,"GenBank accession
(optional)","The GenBank accession for any parasite genetic sequence(s), if appropriate. Accession numbers or other identifiers for related data stored on another platform should be added in a different field (e.g. GISAID Accession, Immport Accession).Researchers may also add additional / other fields as appropriate, such as for other genomic sequence data platforms (e.g., GISAID)."
